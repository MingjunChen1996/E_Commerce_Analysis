E-commerce is the activity of buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet. The e-commerce market has changed the way business is transacted, whether in retail or business-to-business, locally or globally. The dataset of this project is from an online store, which includes product information and customer transaction records from 2016 to 2018. The ultimate goal of the company is to improve the sales. In this project, you’re supposed to find out the online shopping behaviors of the customers and make marketing suggestions for the store in order to increase the customers’ life-time value to the company.
