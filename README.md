# E_Commerce_Analysis
E-commerce is the activity of buying or selling of products on online services or over the Internet. The e-commerce market has changed the way business is transacted, whether in retail or business-to-business, locally or globally. The dataset of this project is from an online store, which includes product information and customer transaction records from 2016 to 2018. The ultimate goal of the company is to improve the sales. In this project, you’re supposed to find out the online shopping behaviors of the customers and make marketing suggestions for the store in order to increase the customers’ life-time value to the company.

The objective of this E-commerce project is to test your sql skills as well as data analytics skills.
Firstly, because the dataset is in sql format, you need to load the dataset into the database. For
future analysis, you can either convert the dataset to csv format, or connect to the database
directly in Python/R.
Secondly, please clean the dataset if it contains wrong records, then explore the dataset to
answer the following questions:
1. How’s the trend of website traffic and the number of orders over time? Is there any
correlation between the orders and the website traffic?
2. How’s the sales from the different products over the seasons or months? What are the
popular products? Is there any correlation between different products?
3. How’s the sales of different products with discount? Does the discount promote sales?
4. Dig more into the data and gain more insights, you can choose some E-commerce metrics or
analysis (e.g. churn rate, conversion rate, retention rate, RFM analysis). Based on the insights
from all above questions, do you have any suggestion for the growth of sales?
